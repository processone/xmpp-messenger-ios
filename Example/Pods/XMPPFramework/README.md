An XMPP Framework in Objective-C for the Mac and iOS development community.

### Abstract
XMPPFramework provides a core implementation of RFC-3920 (the XMPP standard), along with the tools needed to read & write XML. It comes with multiple popular extensions (XEP's), all built atop a modular architecture, allowing you to plug-in any code needed for the job. Additionally the framework is massively parallel and thread-safe. Structured using GCD, this framework performs well regardless of whether it's being run on an old iPhone, or on a 12-core Mac Pro. (And it won't block the main thread... at all)

### Install

The minimum deployment target is iOS 8.0 / macOS 10.8.

The easiest way to install `XMPPFramework` is using CocoaPods. Remember to add to the top of your `Podfile` the `use_frameworks!` line (even if you are not using swift):

- This will install the whole framework with all the avaiable extensions:

```ruby
# The version pushed to CocoaPods is very out of date, use master branch for now
pod 'XMPPFramework', :git => "https://github.com/robbiehanson/XMPPFramework.git", :branch => 'master'
# pod 'XMPPFramework'
```

- If you want to pick what extensions to install:

```
pod 'XMPPFramework/XEP-0009'
pod 'XMPPFramework/XEP-0224'
```

After `pod install` open the `.xcworkspace` and import:

```
import XMPPFramework      // swift
@import XMPPFramework;   //objective-c
```
